The data used as the object are English-language film reviews sourced from the Kaggle. This review was collected from the IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Data has been classified into two classes, namely positive and negative classes. The amount of data used was 5000 reviews, with 2500 reviews that were positive and 2500 reviews that were negative.
The preprocessing carried out based on the sequence steps includes case folding, tokenizing and stopwords removal.
